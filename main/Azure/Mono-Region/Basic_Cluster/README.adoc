= Mono-Region: Basic Configuration

In Redis Enterprise, a cluster is a set of cloud instances, virtual machine/container nodes, or bare-metal servers that let you create any number of Redis databases in a memory/storage pool that’s shared across the set. The cluster doesn’t need to scale up/out (or down/in) whenever a new database is created or deleted. A scaling operation is triggered only when one of the predefined limit thresholds has been reached, such as memory, CPU, network, and storage IOPS.

Redis Enterprise cluster is built on a complete separation between the data-path components (i.e proxies and shards) and the control/management path components (i.e. cluster-management processes), which provides a number of significant benefits:

The Basic configuration consist of a Redis Enterprise Cluster of 3 nodes deployed in one availability zone within a single Azure region.

If you run with `client_enabled=true` a client machine with memtier CLI already installed on it, will be created on the same colocated network & infrastructure.
