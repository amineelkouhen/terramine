= Mono-Region: Rack Aware Configuration

Rack-zone awareness is a Redis Enterprise feature that helps to ensure high-availability in the event of a rack or zone failure.

When you enable rack-zone awareness in a Redis Enterprise Software cluster, you assign a rack-zone ID to each node. This ID is used to map the node to a physical rack or logical zone. The cluster can then ensure that master shards, corresponding replica shards, and associated endpoints are placed on nodes in different racks/zones.

In the event of a rack or zone failure, the replicas and endpoints in the remaining racks/zones are promoted. This ensures high availability when a rack or zone fails.

The Rack Aware configuration consist of a Redis Enterprise Cluster of 3 nodes deployed in distinct availability zones within a single AWS region.

If you run with the `rs-client` block, a bastion machine will be created on the same colocated network & infrastructure.

You can create the same configuration in a private mode by activating the flag `private_conf=true`. In this case, the cluster will be created in private subnets (one in each availability zone) and will be reachable only by a bastion node. This configuration, will create a NAT (Network Address Translation) gateway, so the clusters' nodes in the private subnets can connect to services outside the VPC (e.g. downloading packages) but external services cannot initiate a connection with those instances.
