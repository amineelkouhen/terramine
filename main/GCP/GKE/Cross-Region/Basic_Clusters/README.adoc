= Cross-Project/Region: Basic Configuration on GKE

This configuration consists of a Kubernetes cluster of nodes that are deployed within a GCP data center in a specific project or region (ex. ```europe-west1``` region), connected to another Kubernetes cluster of nodes that are deployed within another project or region (ex. ```us-central1``` region). Each cluster is deployed in one availability zone.

Between these two clusters, two VPC peerings are created. Unlike AWS, a VPC peering is an unidirectionnal connection that enables traffic between one VPC to another. To make the traffic bi-directionnal, you need to create another VPC peering for the opposite direction. Thus, instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network.

IMPORTANT: In Google Cloud, a VPC is a global recource (project-specific). It can be created across multiple regions. You can create a cross-region configuration (eg. Active-Active) without the need to create VPC peerings. However, if there is any need to create traffic between two distinct GCP projects, you need to create a https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc[shared VPC^] or create VPC peerings. 

This configuration fits scenarii that need geographical distribution of data like, Active-Passive or Active-Active:

== Unidirectional Replication (Active-Passive)

With Redis Enterprise you can create Active-Passive Geo-Distributed deployments using the “replica-of” capability. This unidirectional replication capability allows you to synchronize data between source and destination databases, placing the data physically closer to the user for low-latency read access. All writes to the source database are replicated to destination databases. However, writes to the destination databases are not replicated back to source databases.

This figure illustrates Active-Passive Geo-Distributed topology using replica-of:

== Bi-Directionnal Replication (Active-Active)

An Active-Active architecture is a data resiliency architecture that distributes the database information over multiple data centers via independent and geographically distributed clusters and nodes. It is a network of separate processing nodes, each having access to a common replicated database such that all nodes can participate in a common application ensuring local low latency with each region being able to run in isolation.

Active-Active Architecture or an Active-Active Geo-Distributed topology is achieved by implementing CRDTs (conflict-free replicated data types) in Redis Enterprise using a global database that spans multiple clusters. This is called a “conflict-free replicated database” or “CRDB.”

CRDB provides three fundamental benefits over other geo-distributed solutions:

- It offers local latency on read and write operations, regardless of the number of geo-replicated regions and their distance from each other.
- It enables seamless conflict resolution (“conflict-free”) for simple and complex data types like those of Redis core.
- Even if most of the geo-replicated regions in a CRDB (for example, 3 out of 5) are down, the remaining geo-replicated regions are uninterrupted and can continue to handle read and write operations, ensuring business continuity.

On Kubernetes, Redis Enterprise Active-Active databases provide read and write access to the same dataset from different Kubernetes clusters.

Creating an Active-Active database requires routing network access between two Redis Enterprise clusters residing in two different Kubernetes clusters. Without the proper access configured for each cluster, syncing between the databases instances will fail.
