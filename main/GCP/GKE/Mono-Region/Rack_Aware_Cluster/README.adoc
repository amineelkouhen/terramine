= Mono-Region: Rack Aware Configuration on GKE

Rack-zone awareness is a Redis Enterprise feature that helps to ensure high-availability in the event of a rack or zone failure.

When you enable rack-zone awareness in a Redis Enterprise Software cluster, you assign a rack-zone ID to each node. This ID is used to map the node to a physical rack or logical zone. The cluster can then ensure that master shards, corresponding replica shards, and associated endpoints are placed on nodes in different racks/zones.

In the event of a rack or zone failure, the replicas and endpoints in the remaining racks/zones are promoted. This ensures high availability when a rack or zone fails.

Kubernetes is an excellent orchestration tool, but it was not designed to deal with all the nuances associated with operating Redis Enterprise. Therefore, it can fail to react accurately to internal Redis Enterprise edge cases or failure conditions. Also, Kubernetes orchestration runs outside the Redis Cluster deployment and may fail to trigger failover events, for example, in split network scenarios.

To overcome these issues, Redis created a layered architecture approach that splits responsibilities between operations Kubernetes does well, procedures Redis Enterprise Cluster excels at, and the processes both can orchestrate together. The figure below illustrated this layered orchestration architecture:

The Redis Enterprise operator uses custom resource definitions (CRDs) to create and manage Redis Enterprise clusters (REC) and Redis Enterprise databases (REDB).

The operator is a deployment that runs within a given namespace. These operator pods must run with sufficient privileges to create the Redis Enterprise cluster resources within that namespace.

The Rack Aware configuration consists of a Kubernetes cluster of 3 nodes deployed deployed in three distinct availability zones within a single GCP region. On top of that, Redis Enterprise Operator is installed, and the following resources are created:

- a service account under which the operator will run,
- a set of roles to define the privileges necessary for the operator to perform its tasks,
- a set of role bindings to authorize the service account for the correct roles (see above),
- the CRD for a Redis Enterprise cluster (REC),
- the CRD for a Redis Enterprise database (REDB).
