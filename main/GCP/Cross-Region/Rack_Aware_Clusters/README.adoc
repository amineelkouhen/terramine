= Cross-Project/Region: Rack Aware Configuration

This configuration consists of a cluster of nodes that are deployed within a GCP data center in a specific project or region (ex. ```europe-west1``` region), connected to another cluster of nodes that are deployed within another project or region (ex. ```us-east1``` region). Each cluster is deployed in a distinct availability zone.

A rack-zone ID is assigned to each node. This ID is used to map the node to a physical rack or logical zone. The cluster can then ensure that master shards, corresponding replica shards, and associated endpoints are placed on nodes in different racks/zones.
